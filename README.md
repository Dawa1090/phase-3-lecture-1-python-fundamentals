- Functions in Python
- raise Exception()

## Introduction

Welcome to Python! In today's lecture, we will discuss the Python Fundamentals including important terminal commands, using `ipdb` for debugging, control flow, functions, and using `raise Exception()` to raise an Exception.

## Setup

1. Make sure that your current working directory (folder) contains a `Pipfile`, then run `pipenv install` in your terminal to install `pytest` and any other required libraries.
2. Now that your `pipenv` virtual environment is ready to use, enter `pipenv shell` to start working.
3. Run `pytest` from inside of the `phase-3-lecture-1-python-fundamentals` directory (if you can see `lib`, `Pipfile`, `Pipfile.lock`, `pytest.ini`, and `README.md` in your current working directory, then you are in the correct directory) to run the tests, and begin working to pass the tests. You can also run `pytest -x` to run one test at a time.
